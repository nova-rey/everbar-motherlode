## 2026-08-21 — Brick 3 receipt identity repair

Corrected Motherlode’s canonical hash extraction to use Everbar Brick 3’s authoritative `canonical.event_sha256` field. Added a resumable `reconcile` command that backfills existing immutable receipts, and ensured `--resume` skips completed datasets instead of reprocessing them.
